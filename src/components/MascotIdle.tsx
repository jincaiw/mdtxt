 * The welcome mascot. Completely still, with one micro-interaction: its eyes
 * close while hovered. An earlier version waved on mount, blinked on a timer,
 * and did a squash-and-stretch bounce on hover, but the pose frames have
 * slightly different proportions, so every swap read as a glitchy jump
 * instead of an animation. The two same-pose blink frames are the only swap
 * that is pixel-stable, so that's all that remains.
