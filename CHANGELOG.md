## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — Click after scroll lands on the right line

- Scrolling and immediately clicking (or double-clicking) used to land
  the caret on a line one row off from where it visibly looked like
  the click was — typing then added text to the "wrong" line, which
  was confusing. The cause: the highlight overlay's `scrollTop` was
  synced to the textarea via a rAF loop, which catches up on the NEXT
  frame after the scroll. If you clicked inside that 16-ms window, the
  textarea had already placed the caret at the new position but the
  overlay was still painting the old one, so the visible glyph at the
  click coordinate didn't match the textarea's text-position mapping.
- Replaced the rAF loop with a synchronous `onScroll` handler on the
  textarea. The overlay's scrollTop is now updated in the same turn
  as the scroll event, so the two layers stay in lockstep and clicks
  always land where the user expects. Also frees the main thread from
  a 60 Hz rAF callback that was firing whether the editor was idle or
  not.

### Improved — Smaller per-keystroke recompute

- `updateCursorPosition` ran twice per keystroke (selectionchange AND
  keyup both fire). The downstream setStates already bailed via
  `Object.is`, but the substring + split work itself ran twice. Now
  caches the last reported (start, end) range and short-circuits at
  the top when nothing's moved.

### Improved — Cold start and runtime performance

- **Bundle main chunk: 1.08 MB → 282 kB (~74% smaller).** Welcome screen no
  longer ships the markdown rendering pipeline, jspdf/html2canvas, the
  command palette, settings, stats dialog, file explorer, outline panel,
  shortcuts cheatsheet, or the unsaved-changes dialog. Each is its own
  chunk, fetched the moment its surface mounts. `vite manualChunks`
  groups React and the markdown stack into stable vendor chunks the
  WebView2 disk cache can hold across upgrades.
- **First file open: instant.** A `requestIdleCallback` after the welcome
  screen settles starts the markdown chunk download in the background, so
  by the time the user opens a file the bundle is already in cache.
- **Typing path: less work per keystroke.** Command-palette heading scan
  no longer runs on every typing pause — only while the palette is
  actually open. App's per-keystroke `content.split("\n")` for
  `lineCount` moved into MarkdownPreview where it's actually used (one
  fewer full-document scan per keystroke). StatusBar, TitleBar,
  MarkdownPreview, and CodeEditor wrapped in `React.memo` with stable
  callbacks so caret-only re-renders bail out of reconciliation.
- **Highlight cache: drop LRU thrash.** The CodeEditor's per-line
  highlight cache used to do `delete + set` on every cached line per
  render to maintain LRU order — ~20 k Map mutations per keystroke on a
  10 k-line file. The pruning that actually mattered ("is this line
  still in the doc?") doesn't depend on order, so we just lookup-only on
  hit and let the rare hard-cap fallback evict FIFO.

### Added — Chemistry notation in math

- KaTeX now loads the **mhchem** contrib alongside the rest of the math
  bundle, so `\ce{...}` and `\pu{...}` render in the preview.
  This unlocks textbook-grade chemistry: balanced equations, ions,
  isotopes, oxidation states, arrows, and Kröger-Vink defect notation
  (e.g. `$\ce{2 Fe^x_{Fe} + O^x_{O} -> 2 Fe'_{Fe} + V_{O}^{**} + 1/2 O2 ^}$`).
  The math-detection regex now also picks up bare `\ce{` / `\pu{`,
  so chemistry-only documents trigger the lazy load even without
  `$` delimiters. New `/chem` slash command inserts a starter snippet.

### Improved — Book-style math typography

- Display equations are centered with proper vertical breathing room and
  scroll horizontally on narrow viewports instead of overflowing the
  reading column. KaTeX glyphs no longer inherit the global `code` border
  /background, and equation tags pick up the muted-text colour for a
  printed-textbook feel.

### Fixed — Caret drifts off the rendered glyph after scrolling

- The CodeEditor stacks a transparent `<textarea>` on top of a styled
  highlight overlay; alignment relies on both layers wrapping at the
  same column. Once the document grew past the viewport the textarea
  sprouted a vertical scrollbar that quietly ate ~10 px of its content
  area, while the overlay kept its full width. With word-wrap on, the
  two layers wrapped at different columns and the caret started landing
  a character or two off the rendered text after every scroll. Both
  layers now reserve a fixed scrollbar gutter (`scrollbar-gutter: stable`),
  and the overlay's own scrollbar is hidden visually so only the
  textarea's remains user-facing.

### Improved — Editor performance on large documents

- Typing into a 5 k+ line markdown file used to feel "sticky" because
  the highlight overlay mounted every line as a `<div>` and React's
  reconciler walked the lot on every keystroke. The overlay now
  virtualizes: only the lines visible in the viewport (plus a 40-line
  buffer) render, with fixed-height spacers above and below preserving
  scroll-height parity with the textarea so caret alignment is intact.
  Re-renders only fire when the visible window shifts by more than half
  the buffer, so smooth scrolling no longer thrashes setState.
  Word-wrap mode and small docs (under 400 lines) keep the previous
  full-render path. Per-line wrapper styles are also hoisted to module
  scope and the non-virtualized list is wrapped in `React.memo` so
  unchanged lines short-circuit prop diffing.

### Fixed — Webview accelerator collision

- AI assist shortcut now also responds to **Alt+J**. On Windows, WebView2
  treats `Ctrl+J` as a "browser accelerator" for the built-in Downloads
  UI — the page never sees the keydown, so `e.preventDefault()` can't
  rescue it. Alt+J skips that path entirely. macOS (WKWebView) and Linux
  (WebKitGTK) keep `Ctrl+J` working; the cheatsheet detects the platform
  and shows the right one. A capture-phase `keydown` listener also
  preventDefaults Ctrl+J app-wide, so on platforms where the page does
  see the event the host webview's default action is suppressed
  regardless of which element is focused.

### Fixed — Security

- `read_file` / `save_file` refuse documents above 50 MB. Stat happens before
  the read so an oversized file fails fast with a clear "File too large"
  toast instead of pulling hundreds of MB of UTF-8 into the webview while
  the UI freezes.
- `save_image` refuses payloads above 25 MB and now enforces an extension
  whitelist (`png`, `jpg`, `jpeg`, `gif`, `webp`, `bmp`, `svg`,
  case-insensitive). A caller can no longer drop a `.exe` / `.dll` / `.lnk`
  into the user's documents folder under cover of the markdown image-paste
  flow. Tests cover the new rejections plus all whitelisted extensions.
- AI requests get a 60 s wall-clock timeout (composed with the user's
  existing `AbortController`) and the response is capped at 200 KB. A
  stuck local llama.cpp or a runaway model can no longer hang the AI
  bubble forever or paste megabytes of text into the editor.
- Tauri CSP further tightened: `object-src 'none'`, `base-uri 'self'`,
  `form-action 'none'`, `frame-ancestors 'none'`. Asset protocol disabled
  (it was scoped to `**` but the app loads images via plugin-fs + blob
  URLs and never touches `asset:`), and `asset:`/`https://asset.localhost`
  dropped from `default-src` and `img-src`.

### Added

- Status bar shows a "selected / total" word count when the editor has a
  non-empty selection; reverts to total when the selection collapses.
- Welcome screen: a Settings button next to Open/New, a "Clear all" link in
  the Recent header, and a visible drag highlight (dashed accent outline +
  hover background) so the drop target is obvious.

### Fixed — UX

- File-operation errors now surface the actual message from Rust
  ("File too large", "Image filename must end in …") instead of the
  generic "Failed to open file" / "Failed to save image. Please try again."
  toasts. Restore-on-launch surfaces TooLarge specifically so a user whose
  yesterday-doc grew above the cap gets an explanation instead of the
  editor silently opening to a blank welcome screen.
- Welcome screen: per-row Remove button on a Recent file used to be a
  `<span role="button">` nested inside the row's `<button>`. That's invalid
  HTML and could double-fire — clicking Remove sometimes also reopened the
  file. Split into two sibling buttons.

### Removed

- Dead `localStorage` helpers `getFocusMode` / `setFocusMode` /
  `getAutoSave` / `setAutoSave`. Both features were retired in 0.6.1 and
  nothing reads these keys anymore.

### Changed — Offline support

- All UI fonts (Inter, JetBrains Mono, Merriweather, Lora, Source Serif 4,
  Fira Sans) and the Material Symbols Outlined icon font are now bundled
  with the app via `@fontsource/*` and `material-symbols`. The
  `<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/...">`
  tags have been removed from `index.html`, so the editor renders identically
  online and offline — no more "icon shows as text" while waiting for the CDN
  on a slow connection.
- Tauri CSP tightened: `style-src` no longer whitelists
  `https://fonts.googleapis.com` and `font-src` no longer whitelists
  `https://fonts.gstatic.com`. Fonts may now load only from `self` (the
  bundled woff2 files) plus `data:` URLs (used by some embedded SVG icons).
- HTML export drops the Google Fonts `@import`. The export now relies on
  font-family fallbacks (system sans/serif/mono) so exporting succeeds
  offline and the resulting file renders predictably anywhere.

### Added

- Word wrap toggle for the editor (Settings → Editor; default on). Wrapped
  mode hides the line-number gutter so per-source-line numbers don't drift
  out of alignment with wrapped visual rows.
- Spell check toggle for the editor (Settings → Editor; default off).
- Document statistics dialog (command palette → "Show document statistics"):
  words, characters, sentences, paragraphs, headings, links, images, code
  blocks, and reading time. Frontmatter and code blocks are excluded from
  prose counts.
- Command palette: "Reveal in folder" and "Copy file path" actions for the
  current file.

### Fixed — Security

- Wikilink resolver now rejects targets containing `..`, path separators,
  drive letters, or NUL bytes. A crafted document can no longer load files
  outside the current folder.
- Rust `save_image` command sanitizes the supplied filename to a bare
  basename, preventing escape from the `images/` subdirectory. Backed by
  unit tests covering common traversal payloads.
- External markdown links (`http(s)://`, `mailto:`) now open in the system
  default handler via `tauri-plugin-opener` instead of navigating the
  webview itself; `rel="noopener noreferrer"` is also set as a fallback.
- AI assist refuses non-`http(s)` endpoints; the Settings modal flags an
  invalid endpoint inline so users get fast feedback before triggering a
  request.
- Settings modal makes it explicit that the AI API key is stored
  unencrypted in localStorage.

### Fixed — UX

- AI assist bubble repositions when it would overflow the right or bottom
  edge of the viewport, flipping above the anchor when there is no room
  below.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- "This file was deleted or moved" banner appearing on every opened file (false positive in mtime polling) — feature removed
- Outline panel: scrolling broken and last item bleeding into status bar (missing `flex flex-col` + `min-h-0` chain on the panel)
- TOC links inside markdown body (e.g. `[Q1](#q1)`) not navigating to their headings — explicit click handler added with fuzzy heading-text fallback for non-matching slugs
- New File button doing nothing visible — `hasFile` now considers a blank `Untitled.md` buffer as "open"
- Command palette on the welcome screen exposing Save / Save As / view toggles that wouldn't work without a buffer

### Removed

- Auto-save toggle (UI removed from Settings dropdown, Settings modal, command palette, status bar)
- Focus-mode dimming of non-active editor lines — all lines now render at full opacity (typewriter mode kept)
- External-change polling that was watching the open file's mtime

### Changed

- Wikilink resolution and recent-file existence checks use the existing `get_file_info` Rust command instead of the fs plugin's `stat`

## [0.6.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added — Editor

- Tab / Shift+Tab indent (multi-line aware)

- Markdown formatting shortcuts: Ctrl+B / Ctrl+I / Ctrl+K / Ctrl+/
- Find & Replace (Ctrl+F / Ctrl+H) with regex, case-sensitive, match counter
- Slash commands `/` with 13 block transformations
- Smart paste: URL → link, plain URL → autolink, rich HTML → markdown (Turndown), TSV → GFM table
- Tab navigation inside markdown tables (skips separator, creates rows)
- Formatting toolbar above editor (toggleable)
- Focus mode (dim non-active lines)
- Typewriter mode (caret stays vertically centered)

- Outline pane highlights the heading the cursor is in; filter input for large docs
- AI assist scaffold (Ctrl+J) — Rewrite / Shorten / Expand / Continue / Translate via configurable OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama, llama.cpp, OpenAI, etc.)
- Reading time and character count in StatusBar

### Fixed

- Caret no longer drifts vertically between the textarea and syntax-highlight overlay (font metric alignment, empty-line rendering, rAF-driven scroll sync)
- Paper theme `--text-muted` darkened to pass WCAG AA contrast
- Sidebar panels (FileExplorer, TableOfContents) now trap focus
- Toast errors announce as `role="alert"` / `aria-live="assertive"`
- `prefers-reduced-motion` is respected globally

### Changed

- Visible focus rings on all interactive elements (keyboard focus only)
- Design tokens for radius and spacing in `:root`
- StatusBar replaces inert "UTF-8" with icons next to word count and reading time
- TitleBar shows a hint when no file is open
- Welcome screen lists New File alongside Open File and surfaces Ctrl+P / `?` hints
